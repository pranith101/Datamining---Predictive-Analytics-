Brief Description of the dataset: This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.

Problem Addressed: The main aim of the data is to predict the motor and total UPDRS(Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale) scores ('motor_UPDRS' and 'total_UPDRS') from the 16 voice measures.

Why is it important: Parkinson disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It results from the death of dopamine generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the mid-brain. This disease affects about 1% of the world population over the age of 55.

Number of variables and instances: 26 variables and 5875 instances.
